    "# OOI Arrays: Overview and Context for CHLA Profiling\n",
    "**Author:** Eli Holmes (NOAA)</br>\n",
    "Last updated: Dec 5, 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI)](https://oceanobservatories.org/) is a long-term, NSF-funded ocean observing program designed to provide continuous, high-resolution measurements across key regions of the global and coastal ocean.  \n",
    "OOI systems collect physical, chemical, biological, and geological observations using a combination of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Moorings: fixed location** (surface, mid-water, deep-water) — These are sensors at fixed discrete depths. CHLA is available only at those specific depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Depth Profiler systems: fixed location**  \n",
    "  - **Wire-following profilers (WFPs)** — Provide high-resolution vertical depth profiles, sampling repeatedly up and down the water column.  \n",
    "  - **Shallow profilers (SPs)** — Motorized profilers delivering dense CHLA depth profiles in the 0-200m range, often with higher sampling frequency than WFPs.  \n",
    "  - **Deep profilers (DPs)** — Provide deep water (> 200m) vertical profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autonomous gliders: moving location** — Mobile platforms that execute repeated sawtooth depth profiles and produce full vertical CHLA measurements for each dive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across these platforms, OOI instruments collect high-frequency, vertically resolved biological measurements, including:\n",
    "chlorophyll-a concentration, particulate organic matter & phytoplankton biomass, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), photosynthetically available radiation (PAR), sea water physical properties (temperature, salinity, and density), dissolved oxygen, nitrate, pH, pCO₂.  We are interested in modeling CHLA vertical depth profiles and will focus on the chlorophyll-a concentration measurement. OOI data is openly available through the OOI Data Portal and ERDDAP servers.\n",

    "## OOI Regional Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "OOI consists of **two major coastal arrays**, a **regional cabled array**, and **four global open-ocean arrays**. Coastal arrays sample continental shelf, slope, and upwelling environments that exhibit strong seasonal biological and physical variability. These sites typically include vertically profiling platforms that provide **full or partial CHLA depth profiles** in the upper 0–200 m. Global Arrays observe key climate-relevant open-ocean regions and generally **do not include vertical profilers**, but they do provide **CHLA at fixed depths** within the 0–200 m zone, which can still be mapped into depth bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coastal Stations:**\n",
    "    - **Endurance Array (Oregon & Washington)** — Samples an eastern boundary upwelling system across nearshore, shelf, and offshore environments. Platforms include surface and subsurface moorings (fixed-depth CHLA), **wire-following profilers** (0–200 m), **cabled shallow/deep profilers**, and autonomous gliders (0–200+ m profiles).\n",
    "    - **Pioneer Array (Northwest Atlantic / Mid-Atlantic Bight)** — Observes cross-shelf and shelf-break frontal systems with strong biological gradients. Platforms include multi-tier moorings, surface buoys, gliders, and (in most years) **shallow profilers** that provided high-resolution 0–200 m CHLA profiles.\n",
    "    - **Regional Cabled Array (Washington–Oregon offshore)** — Provides real-time power and data to offshore slope and deepwater nodes. Only the **cabled shallow profilers** contribute 0–200 m CHLA profiles; most deep or seafloor instruments do not sample CHLA.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Global Stations:**\n",
    "    - **Papa Array (Gulf of Alaska)** — Subarctic gyre; CHLA sensors at fixed depths (typically 7–50 m).\n",
    "    - **Irminger Sea Array (Greenland–Iceland region)** — High-latitude convection region; CHLA at fixed depths in the upper 100 m.\n",
    "    - **Argentine Basin Array (Southwest Atlantic)** — Deep-ocean circulation site; limited CHLA at one or two fixed depths (~30 m).\n",
    "    - **Southern Ocean Array (South of Tasmania)** — High-mixing Southern Ocean environment; CHLA measurements at fixed depths in the upper 50 m.\n",

Data accessed on https://erddap.dataexplorer.oceanobservatories.org/erddap. data_id is the profile_id in file.Per-profile depth-binned CHLA means (0\\xe2\\x80\\x93200 m by 10 m bins) were computed for each depth bin. QC filtering was done on the values using the _qc_agg variable. Values filtered to qc=1.All profiles were kept even if some binned averages were missing. PACE Rrs for all wavelengths, chlor_a, and Kd_490 were extracted from Level 3 4km v 3.1 Daily files. Matching was done by first selecting all profiles with TIME within 24 hours of t_start in the PACE Level 3 file. Note: t_start in the netcdf attributes was used, not the day in the netcdf filename or in the NASA Earthdata CMS. Once all profiles within that timerange were found, the LATITUDE/LONGITUDE point for the Argo profile was matched to the PACE Level 3 4km grid via ds.sel(lon=LONGITUDE, lat=LATITUDE, method='nearest') where ds is an xarray Dataset formed by reading in the PACE file. The actual PACE files used are listed in the dataset under pace_var_file. Note: the PACE data is heavily cloud-affected and the majority (\\xe2\\x89\\x8880%) of PACE pixels are NaN.Data were accessed using earthaccess Python package, example results = earthaccess.search_data(short_name = 'PACE_OCI_L3M_KD', temporal = ('2024-03-01', '2025-11-30'), granule_name='*.DAY.*.4km.*')\",\n",

These sensors emit blue light (~470 nm) to excite chlorophyll pigments in the water and detect the resulting fluorescence in the red band near ~695 nm. Raw fluorescence counts are converted to chlorophyll-a concentration using factory calibration coefficients and OOI processing, which applies standard scale factors, dark corrections, and automated quality-control tests to produce the 'fluorometric_chlor_a' data product (reported in approximately mg m\\xe2\\x81\\xbb\\xc2\\xb3). In this work, we use the OOI fluorometric chlorophyll-a values as provided by the OOI data system, without additional post-processing (e.g., non-photochemical quenching corrections or region-specific bias adjustments), so they should be interpreted as instrument-based estimates of relative chlorophyll-a concentration rather than fully validated absolute values.\",\n",

    "The OOI and PACE (satellite-derived) chlorophyll-a estimates will not match. One is based on reflectance from the water column while the other is in-situ reflectance. But they are correlated. This plot shows a oft observed pattern where the satellite derived estimate is higher when surface CHLA is lower. Conversely, the in-situ surface measurement is a bit higher when CHLA is higher. But note that we don't have many in-situ measurements over 1 (on log10 scale) so about 10 on the non-log scale. According to the PACE measurements we do have values above 1.4 (bloom), but the OOI measurements tend to be lower in those cases.\n",
